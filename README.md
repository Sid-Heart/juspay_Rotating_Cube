# Rotating Cube Problem
Rotating Cube In Purescript

# Question:
Draw a 3D ​Cube wireframe and rotate it along ​the​ ax​es​ that passes through its center. The rotating object should decelerate at a rate of ‘X’ degrees/sec​^​2 before it comes to a standstill.​ ​
The object should respond as follows to the following user inputs

- Swipe​/Drag​:
Accelerates or decelerates the rotating object as per the difference in velocity​
between​​ rotation and swipe with the friction factor Y.​ 
​
- Touch​/Click​​:​ 
Generates friction that should decelerate the rotation further by a Y (friction factor)
